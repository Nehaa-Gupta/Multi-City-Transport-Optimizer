# Multi-City-Transport-Optimizer


The Multi-City Transport Optimizer models a network of cities and transport routes to compute the most efficient travel paths. It applies graph algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s and Floyd-Warshall to minimize travel time or cost across multiple possible connections. The system supports dynamic route updates, handling real-time changes such as delays or new connections. Users can query optimal paths for both direct and multi-leg journeys, making it applicable for logistics and urban transport planning. This project highlights advanced use of graphs, shortest path algorithms, and dynamic data structures for real-world optimization.
